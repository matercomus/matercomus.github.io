I'm excited to share that my first video tutorial was featured on the [DiDi MCP website](http://mcp.didichuxing.com/)! 

## What I Built

I created a simple demo showcasing how to use DiDi MCP (Model Context Protocol) to order taxis directly from within a custom LibreChat deployment. The demo demonstrates the power of integrating MCP servers with chat interfaces to create seamless, real-world functionality.

## Watch the Tutorial

You can watch the full video tutorial here:

Or check it out on the [DiDi MCP showcase page](http://mcp.didichuxing.com/).

## What's Next?

I've since recorded other video tutorials covering various MCP integrations and use cases. I'll be adding more content soon, so stay tuned for updates!

This was a great experience seeing how MCP can bridge the gap between AI assistants and real-world services, making it possible to interact with external APIs and services directly through natural language conversations.
