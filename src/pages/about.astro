	<h2>Background</h2>
	<p>
		I'm an AI/ML Engineer and Research Scientist with a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. 
		My work focuses on developing autonomous agents, LLM-powered applications, and scalable AI systems that bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and production-ready solutions.
	</p>

	<h2>Research & Education</h2>
	<p>
		I'm completing my Master's thesis on synthetic spatio-temporal ride-hailing traffic knowledge graphs, conducting research at both 
		Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and Beijing University of Technology. This work advances urban transportation data analysis through 
		large-scale knowledge graph generation and trajectory classification algorithms.
	</p>
	<p>
		Previously, I worked as a research assistant on the HedgeIoT project, where I built and deployed a Dockerized JupyterHub platform 
		supporting 50+ researchers, designed real-time IoT data collection pipelines, and led conference demonstration development.
	</p>

	<h2>Technical Expertise</h2>
	<p>
		I specialize in building AI agent systems with LangGraph and LangChain, developing RAG architectures, and deploying 
		production-ready AI applications. I'm proficient in Python, PyTorch, and modern ML frameworks, with extensive experience in 
		prompt engineering, multi-agent orchestration, LLM evaluation, and model fine-tuning.
	</p>
	<p>
		I have over 6 years of daily Linux use and strong DevOps skills with Docker, CI/CD, and system design. My background spans 
		NLP, deep learning, IoT data processing, geospatial analysis, and semantic data integration.
	</p>

	<h2>Languages & Location</h2>
	<p>
		I'm fluent in Polish (native) and English, with working knowledge of Chinese (HSK2), Spanish, and Dutch. 
		I'm currently based in Beijing, China, and have lived and studied in Amsterdam, Netherlands.
