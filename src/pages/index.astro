				<h2 class="scroll-m-20 text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight">About Me</h2>
				<p class="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-7">
					I'm an AI/ML Engineer and Research Scientist with a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. 
					My work focuses on developing autonomous agents, LLM-powered applications, and scalable AI systems that bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and production-ready solutions.
				</p>

				<h2 class="scroll-m-20 text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight">Research & Education</h2>
				<p class="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-7">
					I'm completing my Master's thesis on synthetic spatio-temporal ride-hailing traffic knowledge graphs, conducting research at both 
					Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and Beijing University of Technology. This work advances urban transportation data analysis through 
					large-scale knowledge graph generation and trajectory classification algorithms.
				</p>
				<p class="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-7">
					Previously, I worked as a research assistant on the HedgeIoT project, where I built and deployed a Dockerized JupyterHub platform 
					supporting 50+ researchers, designed real-time IoT data collection pipelines, and led conference demonstration development.
				</p>

			<div class="space-y-6">
				<h2 class="scroll-m-20 text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight">Technical Expertise</h2>
				<p class="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-7">
					I specialize in building AI agent systems with LangGraph and LangChain, developing RAG architectures, and deploying 
					production-ready AI applications. I'm proficient in Python, PyTorch, and modern ML frameworks, with extensive experience in 
					prompt engineering, multi-agent orchestration, LLM evaluation, and model fine-tuning.
				</p>
				<p class="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-7">
					I have over 6 years of daily Linux use and strong DevOps skills with Docker, CI/CD, and system design. My background spans 
					NLP, deep learning, IoT data processing, geospatial analysis, and semantic data integration.

			<div class="space-y-6">
				<h2 class="scroll-m-20 text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight">Languages & Location</h2>
				<p class="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-7">
					I'm fluent in Polish (native) and English, with working knowledge of Chinese (HSK2), Spanish, and Dutch. 
					I'm currently based in Beijing, China, and have lived and studied in Amsterdam, Netherlands.
